    <p>
    I never hear that one <sup>+</sup><button class ="switch" data-text-swap="has died">is dead</button><br />
    Without the Chance of Life<br />
    Afresh annihilating me<br />
    That mightiest Belief,<br />
    <br />
    Too mighty for the Daily mind<br />
    That tilling its’ abyss,<br />
    Had Madness, had it once or, Twice<br />
    The <sup>+</sup><button class="switch" data-text-swap="Consciousness of this.">yawning Consciousness</button><br />
    <br />
    Beliefs are Bandaged, like the Tongue<br />
    When Terror were it told<br />
    in any Tone commensurate<br />
    Would strike us instant Dead –<br />
    <br />
    I do not know the man so bold<br />
    He dare in <sup>+</sup><button class="switch" data-text-swap="lone some Place-">lonely Place</button><br />
    That awful stranger – Consciousness<br />
    <sup>+</sup><button class="switch" data-text-swap="look squarely in the Face.">Deliberately face –</button><br />
